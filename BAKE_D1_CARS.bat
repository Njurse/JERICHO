rem  BAKE_D1_CARS.bat -- build the Driver 1 CAR files JERICHO reads, from YOUR
rem                     own copy of Driver 1.
rem
rem  JERICHO does NOT ship Driver 1's content -- it is copyrighted. The seven
rem  Driver 1 car-data cities (MIAMI, FRISCO, LA, NEWYORK, NEWCASTLE, IVIEW, TRAIN) read files
rem  baked OUT of it, so this script makes them from data you already own.
rem
rem  WHAT TO DO
rem    1. Put your Driver 1 game data in DRIVER\, beside DRIVER2\ -- the same
rem       folder layout the game itself uses, so DRIVER\LEVELS\*.LEV is present.
rem    2. Run this script once. It writes DRIVER\D1CARS\.
rem    3. Play. carhacks offers the seven cities from then on.
rem
rem  Re-run it after updating JERICHO if the game says D1CARS is out of date
rem  (bakes from before v0.10.9 lack the D1 wheels and sounds). Re-running is safe.
rem
rem  NEEDS: python on PATH; your Driver 2 data in DRIVER2\ (the wheel geometry
rem  and ride height are derived from Driver 2's own car files, not guessed).
