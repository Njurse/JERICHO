rem  BAKE_D1_CARS.bat -- build the Driver 1 CAR files JERICHO reads, from YOUR
rem                     own copy of Driver 1.
rem
rem  JERICHO does NOT ship Driver 1's content -- it is copyrighted. The seven retail
rem  Driver 1 car-data cities (MIAMI, FRISCO, LA, NEWYORK, NEWCASTLE, IVIEW, TRAIN)
rem  read files baked OUT of it, so this script makes them from data you already
rem  own. If you also have the Euro Demo 43, Beta Miami (BETAMIAMI) comes along.
rem
rem  WHAT TO DO
rem    1. Put your Driver 1 game data in DRIVER\, beside DRIVER2\ -- the same
rem       folder layout the game itself uses, so DRIVER\LEVELS\*.LEV is present.
rem       For Beta Miami, put the Euro Demo 43 LEVELS and SOUND folders in
rem       EURO43\ (its level is EURO43\LEVELS\MIAMI.LEV).
rem    2. Run this script once. It writes JERICHO\MODS\carhacks\D1CARS\.
rem    3. Play. carhacks offers the cities from then on.
rem
rem  The baked blobs live INSIDE carhacks: they are its modded level data, not
rem  part of your Driver 1 disc, and the game reads them from there. The folder is
rem  generated, gitignored, and never part of a release.
rem
rem  Re-run it after updating JERICHO if the game says D1CARS is out of date
rem  (bakes from before v0.10.9 lack the D1 wheels and sounds). Re-running is safe.
rem
rem  NEEDS: python on PATH; your Driver 2 data in DRIVER2\ (the wheel geometry
rem  and ride height are derived from Driver 2's own car files, not guessed).
