#  BAKE_D1_CARS.sh -- build the Driver 1 CAR files JERICHO reads, from YOUR
#                    own copy of Driver 1.
#
#  The Linux/macOS twin of BAKE_D1_CARS.bat: same five steps, same guards,
#  same output. Use whichever matches the machine you are on.
#
#  JERICHO does NOT ship Driver 1's content -- it is copyrighted. The seven retail
#  Driver 1 car-data cities (MIAMI, FRISCO, LA, NEWYORK, NEWCASTLE, IVIEW, TRAIN)
#  read files baked OUT of it, so this script makes them from data you already
#  own. If you also have the Euro Demo 43, Beta Miami (BETAMIAMI) comes along.
#
#  WHAT TO DO
#    1. Put your Driver 1 game data in DRIVER/, beside DRIVER2/ -- the same
#       folder layout the game itself uses, so DRIVER/LEVELS/*.LEV is present.
#       For Beta Miami, put the Euro Demo 43 LEVELS and SOUND folders in
#       EURO43/ (its level is EURO43/LEVELS/MIAMI.LEV).
#    2. Run this script once. It writes JERICHO/MODS/carhacks/D1CARS/.
#    3. Play. carhacks offers the cities from then on.
#
#  The baked blobs live INSIDE carhacks: they are its modded level data, not
#  part of your Driver 1 disc, and the game reads them from there. The folder is
#  generated, gitignored, and never part of a release.
#
#  Re-run it after updating JERICHO if the game says D1CARS is out of date
#  (bakes from before v0.10.9 lack the D1 wheels and sounds). Re-running is safe.
#
#  NEEDS: python3 on PATH; your Driver 2 data in DRIVER2/ (the wheel geometry
#  and ride height are derived from Driver 2's own car files, not guessed).
